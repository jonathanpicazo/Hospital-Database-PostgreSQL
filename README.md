This cs166 project was broken up into 3 different phases. This section, the third phase, requires us to build a client application for the set of dummy data that we are given. We implemented the following queries in java: 

1) Add Doctor: Ask the user for details of a Doctor and add it to the database.
2) Add Patient: Ask the user for details of a Patient and add it to the database.
3) Add Appointment: Ask the user for details of an Appointment and add it to the database. 
4) Make an appointment: Given a patient, a doctor and an appointment of the doctor that s/he wants to take, determine the status of the appointment (Waitlisted/Available/ Active/Past) and add the appointment to the database with appropriate status. 
5) List appointments of a given doctor: Given a doctor ID and a date range, find the list of active and available appointments of the doctor. 
6) List all available appointments of a given department: Given a department name and a specific date, find the list of available appointments of the department. 
7) List total number of different types of appointments per doctor in descending order: Return the list of doctors, the status and number of appointments in a decreasing order of number of different types of appointments that each doctor has. 
8) Find total number of patients per doctor with a given status: Given an appointment status, return the number of patients per doctor with the given status.

We will also include a .txt file that will discuss all of the assumptions that we had made throughout the process and the level of contributions between the two of us.
